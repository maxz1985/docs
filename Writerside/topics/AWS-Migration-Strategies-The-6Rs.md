| Strategy                 | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1. Rehost                | "lift-and -shift"<ul><li>ex. Take an image of the on-prem server and import it into EC2</li><li>ex. use "AWS Application Migration Service" or "AWS VM Import/export"</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2. Replatform            | "lift-tinker-and-shift" or "lift and reshape"<ul><li>ex. convert on premise database to a "database as a service" on AWS (RDS)</li><li>ex. migrate web apps to BeanStalk</li><li>ex. change HTTTP server from WebLogic to Apache Tomcat (save licensing, tomcat is free open source while oracle weblogic is commercial)</li></ul> |
| 3. Repurchase            | Moving to a different product<ul><li>ex. from own CRM to using "Salesforce.com"</li><li>ex. from own HR system to "Workday"</li><li>ex. from own CMS to "Drupal"</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4. Refactor/Re-architect | Re-architect and re-develop application using cloud-native features.<br/>Only used when there is a strong business need to add features, scale or performance that would be difficult to achieve using EC2<br/>ex. move from monolithic arch to SOA or serverless<br/>crazy expensive BUT the most beneficial in the long run      |
| 5. Retire                | Get rid of<br/>statistics show that 10% of applications in any IT environment are unused.<br/>identify owners of applications, obtain justification for continued app use, Retire if no justification                                                                                                                              |
| 6. Retain                | Leave alone as is.<br/>Migration should only be considered if there is a business value. Apps that cannot be migrated resulting in financial benefit for the company should be left alone.                                                                                                                                         |
| Relocate                 | **For applications that are already virtualized** such as running as VMs on VMware, or already running in containers say on local K8s                                                                                                                                                                                              |
