| **Cost**                               | No additional cost                                      | Charges for AWS KMS API requests and key management                | No additional cost from AWS                                     |
| **Integration with AWS Services**      | Basic integration                                       | Tight integration with AWS services and audit via CloudTrail       | Limited (customer-managed keys)                                 |
| **Audit and Access Logs**              | Basic logging in S3                                     | Detailed logging via AWS CloudTrail                                | Limited to S3 logging (no key usage logs)                       |
| **Client-Side Configuration Required** | Minimal (specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header) | Minimal (specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header)            | Requires sending encryption key with each request               |
| **Data in Transit**                    | Encrypted using SSL/TLS                                 | Encrypted using SSL/TLS                                            | Encrypted using SSL/TLS                                         |
| **Use Cases**                          | Default encryption, simple key management               | Regulatory requirements, audit trails, key control                 | Custom key management solutions, on-premises integration        |
| **Advantages**                         | Simple to use, no key management overhead               | Enhanced security features, control over keys, auditing            | Full control over encryption keys                               |
| **Disadvantages**                      | Less control over encryption keys                       | Additional costs, requires managing KMS permissions                | Increased complexity, keys sent over network (requires SSL/TLS) |
| **SSL/TLS Requirement**                | Recommended but not enforced                            | Recommended but not enforced                                       | **Required** (keys sent in requests)                            |
| **Object-Level Control**               | No per-object key control                               | Supports per-object keys via KMS                                   | Full per-object key control                                     |
| **AWS Services Compatibility**         | Supported by most AWS services                          | Supported and provides additional features like encryption context | Limited due to custom key management                            |

**Notes:**

- **SSE-S3**: Ideal for simple use cases where AWS manages all encryption keys transparently.
- **SSE-KMS**: Provides enhanced security with customer control over keys and detailed auditing via AWS KMS.
- **SSE-C**: Gives full control over encryption keys to the customer but requires managing keys and secure key transmission.
