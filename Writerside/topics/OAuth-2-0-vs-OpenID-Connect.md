# OAuth 2.0 vs. OpenID Connect 

OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are complementary protocols. They define how a server authenticates a user,
and then grants the user access to resources.

* OAuth 2.0 controls **authorization** to access a protected resource, like your web app, native app, or API service.
It provides API security through scoped access tokens.
* OIDC extends OAuth 2.0 with user **authentication** and Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality.
It enables you to retrieve and store authentication information about your end users.
It also defines several OAuth 2.0 scopes to enable apps to access user profile information.
