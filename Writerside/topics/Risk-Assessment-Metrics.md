# Risk Assessment Metrics

| Metric                              | Definition                                                                       | Formula                                          | Example                                                                                                  |
|:------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AV (Asset Value)                    | The total value of an asset before any risk occurs.                              | Defined by business valuation or purchase cost.  | If a server costs $100,000, then its AV is $100,000.                                                     |
| EF (Exposure Factor)                | The percentage of asset value that is lost when a threat materializes.           | EF = (Loss Value / Asset Value) × 100%           | If a fire destroys 60% of a $100,000 server, EF = 60%.                                                   |
| SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)        | The estimated monetary loss from a single occurrence of a risk.                  | SLE = Asset Value × EF                           | If an earthquake damages 40% of a $200,000 building, SLE = 200,000 × 0.4 = $80,000.                      |
| ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) | The estimated number of times a specific threat is expected to occur annually.   | Determined through historical data or estimates. | If a flood occurs once every 10 years, ARO = 1/10 = 0.1.                                                 |
| ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)        | The expected total monetary loss due to a risk per year.                         | ALE = SLE × ARO                                  | If SLE = $50,000 and ARO = 0.2, then ALE = 50,000 × 0.2 = $10,000.                                       |
| EV (Expected Value)                 | The expected financial impact of an event occurring, often based on probability. | EV = Probability × Impact                        | If a data breach has a 5% chance of occurring and the impact is $500,000, EV = 0.05 × 500,000 = $25,000. |
