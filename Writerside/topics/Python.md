# Python

### 1. **Core Concepts and Syntax**
- **Question**: What are `Python`'s key differences compared to other programming languages like `Java` or `C#`?
  - Ability to mix OOP and Imperative programming. 
  - Readability and simplicity with clean syntax. No need for `public static void` declarations. Uses `significant space indentation` to frame code blocks, no need for brackets.
  - **`Dynamic typing`** ( `x = 10`, not `int x = 10;`). `Java` and `C#` are statically typed languages.
  - Super rich collection of well supported 3rd party packages suited for any purpose.
  - **Interpreted** vs Compiled. In this context, `Python` is _interpreted_ b/c there is no separate notion of `VM`, pre-compile to bytecode is not a separate stage and `.pyc` files  are not portable.
- **Follow-up**: Can you explain Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and how it impacts multi-threaded applications?

### 2. **Practical Use**
- **Question**: How would you handle and process large datasets in Python? Which libraries would you use?
- **Follow-up**: Could you write a quick Python snippet to demonstrate how to use a `generator` for memory-efficient data processing?

### 3. **Debugging and Testing**
- **Question**: How do you debug Python code, and what tools or techniques do you commonly use?
- **Follow-up**: Have you written unit tests in Python? How would you mock dependencies in a test?
