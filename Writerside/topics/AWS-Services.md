| Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)                    | Has a set of DHCP options attached to VPC.  <br/>Even though multiple sets of DHCP options can be created, only ONE set can be associated with a VPC at one time.  <br/>DHCP options cannot be modified once created. You must create a new set of DHCP options and associate them to the VPC.<br/>[](Add-IPv6-to-an-existing-IPv4-VPC.md). Use `Egress-only Internet Gateway` for allow `IPv6` traffic to the internet.<br/>**Internet Gateway(IGW) does not have a public IP**, instead,it enables communication from devices in the VPC that do have their own public ip (ex EC2) to the internet.<br/>An existing VPC CIDR is _NOT MODIFIABLE_, HOWEVER, VPC can be expanded by adding up to 4 secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks.<br/>For `Multicast` support, create a `Transit Gateway` in the VPC, enable multicast and associate a multicast domain with relevant subnets.<br/>Use `NACL` to block a set of IPs. NACLs are associated with subnets while security groups are associated with instances.<br/>IP addresses cannot be blocked by either a routing table or IGW. You cannot deny traffic just from a particular IP address(es) using security groups<br/>**Site-to-site VPN** requires a `Customer Gateway` in a VPC. `Customer Gateway` requires customer's `ASN` **if routing is** `Dynamic` and customer's **Static IP Address.**<br/>**A** `VPC` **endpoint** is used to connect to other services traversing AWS Private Network.<br/>**`Gateway Endpoints`** are used specifically for `S3` and `DynamoDB`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| AWS IAM Identity Center                               | Use to manage SSO access to AWS using your own AD as authorizer.  <br/>User tries to log into AWS and and the authorization requests is sent to your AD to validate.  <br/>To create SSO with self-managed AD: <ul> <li>Configure AD connector in AWS Directory Service as a Directory Gateway to forward directory requests to Self-managed AD</li> <li>Connect IAM Identity Center to self-managed AD using the AD Connector</li></ul><br/>NOTE: Another way to solve it is to create an AWS-managed AD in AWS and establish 2-way trust between your AD and AWS-managed AD. HOWEVER this approach will cache your AD information in AWS. IF there is security requirement NOT to cache info in AWS, use the Directory Gateway approach.  <br/>IF there is a need to use AWS-managed AD as identity source that can be done in `AWS Identity Center > Settings > Identity source > Change identity source` .

| AWS Service Catalog                                   | Define which services are approved for use. Create, share, organize, and govern your curated IaC templates. Create "products" linked to CloudFormation templates  <br/>Can use "Template Constraints". Add `Template Constraints` to existing "Product" instead of defining new product.   <br/>There are 2 types of constraints: template constraints and launch constraints.  <br/>Template constraints restrict configuration parameters available when launching a "product". Can be used to add limitations to SCP based for example on department, i.e. `dev` can only launch `t1.micro`  <br/>Launch constraints specify IAM role under which the "product" will be launched.<br/>FYI: `Service Actions` use `AWS SSM Documents` to perform actions on the EC2 instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
