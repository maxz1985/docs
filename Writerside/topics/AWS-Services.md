| Amazon AppStream 2.0                            | AppStream 2.0 is an AWS End User Computing (EUC) service that can be configured for **SaaS application streaming** or delivery of **virtual desktops with selective persistence**. When AppStream 2.0 is used for virtual desktops, saved files and application settings remain persistent between user sessions, and a fresh virtual desktop is assigned to the user every time they log on.  <br/>Price is based on a monthly fee per streaming user and stream resource required for provisioning.  <br/>Applications can be accessed via browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Amazon Athena                                   | Not a search and analytics engine. Cannot load data from CloudWatch and Kinesis.  <br/>Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive analytics service built on open-source frameworks, supporting open-table and file formats.  <br/>Athena is built on open-source Trino and Presto engines and Apache Spark frameworks, with no provisioning or configuration effort required.  <br/>Ingests data for analysis from different sources including S3. Can use SQL/ML to analyze/query.  <br/>Supports analysis of SQL data sources, not suitable for analyzing open-source data.  <br/>Can be used with AWs Migration Hub to explore collected data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Amazon Aurora                                   | AWS implementation of serverless MySQL or PostgreSQL DB  <br/>This is NOT MySQL or PostgreSQL - this is AWS OWN database implementation `compatible` with MySQL and PostgreSQL  <br/>When RDS MySQL cannot handle the load, Aurora may be a better choice.  <br/><br/>There are 2 TYPES of Aurora - "Aurora Serverless" and "Aurora" (regular)  <br/>The choice is made when selecting the"DB instance class: "Serverless" OR "Memory optimized" and "Burstable"  <br/>In exam questions when asked about Aurora PAY ATTENTION to DB instance class mentioned.  <br/><br/>"Aurora serverless" is actually serverless.  <br/>Serverless is an on-demand autoscaling configuration. Use for unpredictable workloads and pay on "per-second" basis  <br/><br/>"Aurora" (regular) runs on EC2 instances and is for predictable workloads.  <br/>"Aurora Memory Optimized" is NOT serverless as far as exam questions go. Memory optimized or burstable Aurora actually has an instance type.  <br/><br/>Configure Aurora inside RDS console. Considered part of RDS.  <br/>Use FreeLocalStorage metric in CloudWatch to monitor local storage available for Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL |
