| Amazon AppStream 2.0                                        | AppStream 2.0 is an AWS End User Computing (EUC) service that can be configured for **SaaS application streaming** or delivery of **virtual desktops with selective persistence**. When AppStream 2.0 is used for virtual desktops, saved files and application settings remain persistent between user sessions, and a fresh virtual desktop is assigned to the user every time they log on.  <br/>Price is based on a monthly fee per streaming user and stream resource required for provisioning.  <br/>Applications can be accessed via browser.<br/>Price is based on **monthly fee**<br/>Requires a stream resource.<br/>Generally less expensive than WorkSpaces. If a requirement is to share an _application_ use AppStream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

For example for CPU use instance `CPUUtilization` metric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)                          | Cloud compute VMs. <br/> When assigning multiple **primary** IP addresses to a primary network interface, use `IPv4 Prefixes` feature. <br/> Secondary private IPv4 addresses differ from the primary IP addresses in that secondary IP addresses can be reassigned from one instance to another. For example when an instance fails, its secondary IP addresses can be re-assigned to a healthy instance.<br/>Use `T Intance type`(has burstable CPU) to accommodate cost-conscious workloads with occasional performance jumps.<br/>To create AMI from instance-store-backed EC2:<ul><li>Upload credentials (X509 cert and private key) to the instance.</li><li>run `ec2-bundle-vol` from AMI tools</li><li>run `ec2-upoload-bundle` from AMI tools to upload bundle to S3</li><li>Use `aws ec2 register-image` to register the AMI</li></ul>**Instance-store backed** EC2 limitations: <ul><li>You **cannot create snapshots** of **instance-store backed** EC2 volume.</li><li>You **cannot use AWS Console to create an AMI** of an **instance-store backed** EC2. There is a special procedure for that.</li></ul>To copy EC2 to another region: * Create AMI, * Copy AMI to another region, * Launch EC2 in another region from copied AMI, * If you want to keep the same PEM key, select `Proceed without key pair` when launching EC2. The original `public key` is part of AMI volume.<br/>You _cannot_ import a `private key`. The EC2 key pairs are region-specific and store only the **public key** part of PEM that gets placed on EC2 at launch. <br/>When assigning **multiple IP addresses** to an interface, use `/28 IPv4 Prefix` in advanced properties of network interface. (auto-assign or custom)<br/>For quick recovery of failed EC2 instances, use **Auto Scaling Group**. For *cost-effective* on-demand capacity expansion use Spot Fleet with `diversified` allocation strategy(multi-AZ) and Automatic Scaling enabled.<br/>When running **auto-scaling group** with **ELB**, change the Auto-Scaling group health check type from `EC2` to `ELB`. That will make the group consider **both** EC2 and ELB (HTTP port response) checks before declaring an instance healthy.<br/>Hosting several SSL certs on a single EC2 can be achieved by attaching multiple network interfaces with multiple IP addresses. Note that all EC2's network interfaces have to be ins the same AZ.<br/>EC2 Instance **Metadata** - Hosted on _http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/_.

| Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events)             | Message Bus. Event Bus is a serverless event bus that helps you receive, filter, transform, route, and deliver events. <br/>Receives events from a wide variety of AWS ( ex CloudTrail, AWS Organizations, AWS Config ) and custom services. Events can be acted upon using SNS. <br/>Invocation happens when an event matching the rules is detected and forwarded to target. Ex. `event: a file has been stored in S3- > create invocation -> call some 3rd party API like SalesForce` <br/>Throttling:<ul> <li>EventBridge has an invocation quota(limit).

This URL can be played in both media player and mobile phone browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

A snapshot is taken every 8 hours or after every 5GB of data changes, whichever comes first.<br/>There is no additional change for backup (snapshot) up to 100% of provisioned database space. Which means one daily snapshot is free. Effectively if you set the automated snapshot retention policy to 1 day, we can have a free daily backup.<br/>Database snapshots are stored in S3<br/>**Availability**: Enable **cross-region snapshot copy**.<br/>For cross-Region replication with KMS-encrypted cluster:<ul><li>Set up a snapshot copy grant for a master key in the destination region</li><li> enable cross-region snapshots</li></ul> <br/>Can use HSM certificate to connect to client's HSM to store and retrieve keys that encrypt databases.<br/>Cannot use SPOT instances.<br/>Use `WLM` Work Load Management to manage priorities within workloads so that short, fast-running queries won’t get stuck in queues behind long-running queries. Create two workload management groups and assign the fast and slow queries to each respectively.<br/>If `Redshift` _query_ **hangs or stops responding**:<ul><li>Reduce the size of maximum transmission unit (MTU).</li><li>View the `STV_LOCKS` and `STL_TR_CONFLICT` system tables to find conflicts involving updates to more than one table.</li><li>Use the `PG_CANCEL_BACKEND` function to cancel one or more conflicting queries.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)                          | [S3 SSE Encryption Types Comparison](S3-SSE-Encryption-Types.md). Pay attention to the encryption **type** mentioned. Mentioning just **SSE** could mean **any** of the 3 types. If the requirement is to "keep the encryption key private" or "restrict access to keys to handful of individuals" then SSE-C or SSE-KMS should be used, but the question may mention SSE without specifying.<br/>S3 is **not a POSIX-compliant** storage.<br/>When a bucket is encrypted with SSE-KMS, use S3 Bucket Keys to avoid calling KMS too much.<br/>When there is a requirement to store large amounts of data cost-effective and with high availability and durability, consider S3.<br/>Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3): there are no separate permissions for the envelope key(master key). Each object is encrypted with unique key. The object key itself is encrypted with a Master Key that Amazon regularly rotates.<br/>Use `ACL`s only if you need to control access to individual **objects** in the bucket. Otherwise use Policies.<br/>Use **Requester Pays** feature to charge the GET requests to requester. Otherwise all retrievals from a bucket are always charged to bucket owner, including cross-account requests.<br/>`Cross-Region Replication`(CRR) is a bucket-level configurations that enables asynchronous copying of objects between regions.<br/>**S3 is durable storage.** (databases are NOT durable storage) To generate reports<ul><li>Generate reports from Multi-AZ MySQL database with Read Replicas</li><li>Set up batch job to put reports in S3</li><li>Launch CloudFront distribution to cache report content with TTL to expire daily</li></ul>**S3 Bucket can be enables as a static website**. In bucket properties enable website hosting and specify `index` document. Normally used with CloudFront and OAC (origin access control) to prevent direct bucket access by clients.<br/>S3 Static websites:<ul><li>**Cannot** host:<ul><li>**e-commerce platforms**</li><li>**blogs with comments**</li><li>**web apps with logins**</li><li>dynamic content generation</li><li>server-side scripting</li></ul></li><li>**CAN** Host:<ul><li>**ReactJS or Angular with pre-compiled assets**</li><li>pre-rendered HTML pages, CSS files, and images</li></ul></li></ul>Use `SSE-C` "Server-Side Encryption with Customer-provided keys" for *highly secure environments*. The default `SSE-S3` "Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys" uses *AWS-maintained* AES-256 key.<br/>[`SSE-C`](SSE-C.md) requires usage of **special HTTP Request Headers**.<br/>To **maximize the bandwidth usage** of a large file upload to `S3`, use AWS CLI `aws s3 cp`. This CLI performs a **multi-part upload** with parts uploading in **parallel** and the ability to restart a failed part.<br/>To transfer data while having a **limited bandwidth** use `aws S3 sync {source} {destination}` in preparation for cut over. At the cut over weekend, run the final sync and cut over.<br/>S3 Versioning:<ul><li>`Version ID` can be either `null` or an alphanumeric string `34djlcj...`</li><li>`Version ID` is set to `null` for all objects that were **already present** in a bucket when the versioning was enabled AND **have not yet been changed since then**</li><li>Any object added to the bucket **after the versioning is enabled** will have an **alphanumeric Version ID** assigned</li><li>When any object with a `null` `Version ID` is changed, it will receive an alphanumeric `Version ID`</li></ul>S3 [Prefixes](S3-Object-Storage.md) can be used to **partition** data in S3. The `Cache-Control` or `Expires` [HTTP Response Headers](HTTP-Headers.md) can be added to S3 Objects by prefix in order to control `CloudFront` caching.<br/>To **block public access to an S3 bucket**, enable `Amazon S3 Block Public Access`.<br/>Use _CORS_ (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) bucket configuration to enable a website from a different domain access to S3.<br/>Use **Object-Level Logging** to track `PutObject` API requests with public read permissions. |

| Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)                          | Has a set of DHCP options attached to VPC. <br/>Even though multiple sets of DHCP options can be created, only ONE set can be associated with a VPC at one time.  <br/>DHCP options cannot be modified once created. You must create a new set of DHCP options and associate them to the VPC.<br/>[](Add-IPv6-to-an-existing-IPv4-VPC.md). Use `Egress-only Internet Gateway` to allow `IPv6` traffic to the internet.<br/>**Internet Gateway(IGW) does not have a public IP**, instead,it enables communication from devices in the VPC that do have their own public ip (ex EC2) to the internet.<br/>An existing VPC CIDR is _NOT MODIFIABLE_, HOWEVER, VPC can be expanded by adding up to 4 secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks.<br/>For `Multicast` support, create a `Transit Gateway` in the VPC, enable multicast and associate a multicast domain with relevant subnets.<br/>Use `NACL` to block a set of IPs from reaching a subnet in a VPC. NACLs are associated with subnets while security groups are associated with instances. Neither `NACL` nor `Security Groups` are capable of  URL-based filtering. <br/>When **URL-based filtering** is required, set up a _web proxy server_ in your VPC, redirect  all EC2 traffic through proxy. ex use 3rd party like `Squid`. <br/>Security Groups:<ul><li>**Operates at the _instance_ level**</li><li>Traffic is _denied_ by default unless an allow rule exists</li><li>**Stateful** - when request is sent from an instance, the return traffic is allowed back in regardless of inbound security group rules</li><li>Stateful - responses to _allowed_ inbound traffic are allowed to leave the instance regardless of outbound security rules</li><li>Supports **allow rules only**</li></ul>Network ACLs (NACL):<ul><li>**Operates at the _subnet_ level**</li><li>Traffic is _allowed_ by default</li><li>**Stateless** - requires separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic</li><li>Stateless - requires matching inbound/outbound rules</li><li>Supports **both allow and deny** rules</li></ul>IP addresses cannot be blocked by either a routing table or IGW. You cannot deny traffic just from a particular IP address(es) using security groups<br/>**Site-to-site VPN** requires a `Customer Gateway` in a VPC. `Customer Gateway` requires customer's `ASN` **if routing is** `Dynamic` and customer's **Static IP Address.**<br/>**A** `VPC` **endpoint** is used to connect to other services traversing AWS Private Network.<br/>**`Gateway Endpoints`** are used specifically for `S3` and `DynamoDB`.<br/>NOT POSSIBLE:<ul><li>not possible to set up VPN between VPCs</li><li>not possible to set up Direct Connect between VPCs</li></ul>Use VPC Peering instead. There is also `Inter-Region VPC Peering` if VPCs are in different regions.<br/>Only **ONE** _Virtual Private Gateway_ (`VGV`) can be attached to a `VPC`.<br/>A `VPC` can span multiple AZs BUT subnets cannot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

However `Migration Hub` is just for viewing the data, not for TCO calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The tag will appear on reports that are run post-activation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)                               | Provision and manage public and private SSL/TLS certificates with AWS services.<br/>A _Region-bound_ Service. ACM Certificate can only be used by AWS services in the same region where certificate is created.<br/> For **Multi-Region** deployments, manually request and deploy individual certificates in each Region. This is because ACM **public** certificates **cannot be exported** for use with external resources, since the private keys aren’t made available to users and are managed solely by AWS.<br/>**CloudFront is an exclusion from the above rule**. For CloudFront, you must request the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM certificates in this region that are associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution.<br/>ACM Can be used to **import** valid non-expired 3rd party certificates. For _China_ region where ACM is not available, use **`IAM Certificate Store`**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.<br/>For analyzing the **cross-account IAM role activities**, use `Detective + GuardDuty` , do not use `CloudTrail Logs` or `Event History`  <br/>Shows 90 days history specifically for "management events"  <br/>Collect CloudTrail Logs from **multiple accounts**: <ol> <li>turn on CloudTrail in destination account</li> <li>update permissions on S3 bucket in destination account to allow CloudTrail services in other accounts to write to destination account (cross-account permissions)</li> <li>Turn on CloudTrail in each of the source accounts</li> <li>Configure CloudTrail in each source account to dump logs to the S3 bucket of the destination account</li> </ol>To collect `CloudTrail` logs for a **single account across multiple regions**, create a `CloudTrail` with `Apply trail to all regions: YES` (or AWS CLI ` --is-multi-region-trail`) and deliver to an S3 bucket.<ul><li>To collect events for global services like IAM make sure that "global services option"(`IncludeGlobalServiceEvents : true`) (or AWS CLI `--include-global-service-events`) is set.</li><li> To store logs, use a new bucket without previous access policies</li><li>create IAM roles</li><li>set S3 bucket policies</li><li>optionally enable MFA on S3 Delete operation</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| AWS Direct Connect                                          | A dedicated network connection to AWS Network. This is an actual network circuit that runs from your location to AWS Direct Connect Partner. Typically the partner will provision the circuit.<br/>Overall provisioning from start to working circuit can take 90 days.<br/>There are 2 types of connections<ul><li>**Dedicated** - your location connects directly to a physical port that **you own** on the AWS Concentrator at partner</li><li>**Hosted** - you location connects to an AWS Concentrator port **owned by the partner** and **shared with other partner's customers**.</li></ul>While in transit, your network traffic remains on the AWS global network and never touches the public internet.<br/>Takes a long time (one to several months) to set up. In a rush use VPN while Direct Connect is being setup.<br/> If the requirement is a **dedicated connection and predictable transfer performance**, choose Direct Connect over VPN. For accessing VPCs in multiple regions, use` Direct Connect Gateway`, create a  **virtual private gateway** in each VPC and create **private virtual interface** between` Direct Connect Endpoint` and `Direct Connect Gateway`.<br/> [See AWS Direct Connect](AWS-Direct-Connect.md#direct-connect-gateway-to-connect-vpcs-in-different-regions-private-virtual-interface)<br/>To access **public** AWS services like `S3` use **public virtual interface**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)(NLB, ALB, Classic, Gateway) | Balance requests between AZs but within the same Region  <br/>Supports TLS off-load releasing the instances behind NLB from performing TLS encrypt/decrypt.  <br/>To use TLS off-load, create TLS listener on NLB on port 443.<br/>**Outbound** traffic **cannot be routed** through ELB.<br/>Use `ELB` to balance containers and instances, use `Route 53 Weighted Routing` to balance RDS instances.<br/>Can integrate with WAF to prevent attacks.<br/>If `Auto Scaling Group` member instances in a particular `AZ` do not receive requests from the `ELB`, ADD that `AZ` to the `ELB`. Individually registering instances with `ELB` is NOT REQUIRED. Instances that are launched by your Auto Scaling group are automatically registered with the load balancer.<br/>To host **multiple domains** use either a **cert with multiple SANs** or **bind several certificates to the `ALB`**. Note that _Classic Load Balancer_ does NOT support multiple certificates.<br/><ul><li>Classic Load Balancer supports `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `TCP`, `SSL`</li><li>ALB supports `HTTP` and `HTTPS`</li></ul>For **Sticky Sessions** Classic Load Balancer creates `AWSELB` cookie which is used to map the session to the instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)                         | To maintain capacity for supporting RPO/RTO metrics, use `EC2 Capacity Provider` associated with `EC2 Auto-Scaling Group`. ECS will then maintain the size of the auto-scaling group to ensure cluster is always at specified capacity. Good for  underlying hardware failure remediation. <br/> Auto-scaling groups can scale the number of tasks based on CPU usage <br/> Fargate will automatically ensure spread between AZs providing availability.<br/> ECS clusters require a load balancer.<br/> Useful for microservices.<br/>For secure ECS deployment use `awsvpc` [Network Mode](ECS-Task-Definitions.md#task-network-modes), security groups and IAM role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Use CloudFormation to create and maintain all other resources at recovery site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| AWS IAM (Identity and Access Manager)                       | Can check **services last accessed information** in OU or ORG by going to `IAM->Access Reports->Organization activity`(also called "**IAM Access Advisor**")and checking "last accessed" date <br/>There is also "Access Advisor" in `IAM ->  Policies -> {policy nane}` which shows what entity and when last used a permission allowed in the policy.

(_except in case of `Discovery Service Agentless Collector` - use IAM User_) <br/>For global services, AWS Config should be enabled only in a single region.  <br/>For Web Identity Federation (federation with OpenID Connect [OIDC] compatible providers like Facebook, Google,etc)  use `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. However consider using `Cognito` for web federation as it is a super-set of IAM functionality and acts as an Identity broker.<br/>To configure IAM Identity Service based on third-party SAML idP:<ol><li>Get the SAML Metadata Document from idP</li><li>Create a *SAML Identity Provider Object* in AWS IAM Console.</li><li>Configure SAML idP with relying party trust</li><li>In idP, configure SAML assertions for the authentication response</li></ol><br/>To allow external auditor read-only access to your Org AWS accounts, create IAM role with read-only permissions in **each account**, allow auditor's IAM user to assume the ARN of this role.<br/>Cross-Account Access:<ul><li>the cross-account roles are always created in the account whose resources are to be accessed</li><li>Then users are created in the account that will be accessing the resources and are given the roles</li><li>use **resource-based** cross-account when **IAM User does not want to give up permissions** and destination service supports it</li><li>use **identity-based** cross-account when **IAM User can `sts:AssumeRole`** or destination service does not support resource-based policies</li></ul>`Service-linked Role`  is a unique type of IAM role that is **linked directly to an AWS service**. Service-linked roles are predefined by the service and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. **Service-Linked Roles are NOT affected by SCP**<br/>IAM Policies:<ul><li>the `*` wildcard **at the end** of `Resource` `ARN` is invalid</li><li>Wildcards `*` are allowed in the `Action`, `Resource`, `Principal` and `Condition` fields.</li><li>can be `Identity-Based` (for user, group, role) or `Resource-Based` (for services)</li><li>You **Cannot** associate a policy with an EC2 Instance.

| AWS IAM Identity Center                                     | Use to manage SSO access to AWS using your own AD as authorizer.  <br/>User tries to log into AWS and and the authorization requests is sent to your AD to validate.  <br/>To create SSO with self-managed AD (Allow entities in a AWS VPC to sign in using self-manged AD): <ul> <li>Configure **AD connector** in AWS Directory Service Console as a **Directory Gateway** to forward directory requests to the self-managed AD</li> <li>Connect IAM Identity Center to self-managed AD using the AD Connector</li></ul><br/>NOTE: Another way to solve it is to create an AWS-managed AD (`AWS Directory Service`) and establish 2-way trust between your AD and AWS-managed AD. HOWEVER this approach will cache your AD information in AWS. IF there is security requirement NOT to cache info in AWS, use the Directory Gateway approach.  <br/>IF there is a need to use AWS-managed AD as identity source that can be done in `AWS Identity Center > Settings > Identity source > Change identity source` .

Pipelines cannot be selected for sharing, so **cannot create "shared pipelines"**.<br/>When `AWS RAM` is integrated with `AWS Organizations`, use `trusted access` by running `aws ram enable-sharing-with-aws-organization` cli.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)                       | Transactional relational database row structure 64TB limit. (OLTP)<br/>Supports: PostgreSQL, Oracle (19c and 21c), SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora. Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) is NOT SUPPORTED on RDS. Use `Multi-AZ RDS` deployment instead. <br/>If you need to **migrate** the RAC to AWS in order to use features NOT present in RDS, use EC2 instances in multiple AZs, EBS Snapshots for backup and Patch manger for patching.<br/>Use `FreeStorageSpace` metric in CloudWatch to monitor storage.<br/>RDS supports storage autoscaling<br/>Use RDS MySQL `Read Replicas` in combination with `Elasticache` to increases **read** performance. `Read Replicas` use **asynchronous** replication. <br/>Traffic cannot be distributed to a `standby instances`, they are only for fail overs  <br/>When expected incoming **traffic is very high**, use`Redshift` for better scalability.<br/>For region-resistant DR use RDS Cross-region Automated Backups. No need for AWS Backup for RDS. <br/> Changing DB Class (underlying instance type) causes DB instance to be rebooted. Only do this during a maintenance window.  <br/> Use `Route 53` `weighted records` with the same weight to evenly distribute read request loads across all DB read replicas.<br/>**RDS Consolidated Billing with Reserved Instances**. To piggyback on unused reserved instance billing with on-demand RDS:<ul><li>Launch in the same Region</li><li>DB Engine should match (i.e if reserved is MySQL, on-demand is MySQL)</li><li>Instance class should match (ex. both m1.large)</li><li>Deployment type should match (ex. both Multi-AZ)</li><li>[Amazon RDS Reserved DB Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidatedbilling-other.html#consolidatedbilling-rds)</li></ul>**DB Snapshot** with point in time recovery **cannot be restored on TOP of the existing database**. A new RDS instance should be created for restore.<br/>RDS for Oracle does NOT support `RMAN` backup utility. There is no shell access to a manged RDS DB. It is possible to perform an RMAN backup on a managed instance by using Amazon RDS package `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util`. However, **You can't use the RMAN to restore RDS for Oracle DB instances**. <br/>When **failure** of a Zone occurs in **Multi-AZ** deployments, the **CNAME** is switched to point to standby.<br/>For MySQL and PostgreSQL in Amazon RDS, there are **two types of Multi-AZ deployment**:<ul><li>**Multi-AZ DB instance** uses **synchronous block storage replication**. Standby can't be used for reads</li><li>**Multi-AZ DB cluster** uses the database's write-ahead log (WAL) to stream changes to two standby databases. The primary database waits for acknowledgement from at least one of the standby databases before committing. Standby can be used for reads. </li></ul>**Sharding in RDS is NOT a native feature**. Requires creating multiple RDS instances and managing the distribution of data across them. Effectively you "shard" your database by splitting data across multiple instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Very **manual** but better than `VM Import/Export` tool. For a more automated process use Application Migration Service.<br/> Able to do _incremental replication_ by creating a new EBS snapshot for every replication. Creates an EBS volume and snapshots then converts them to an AMI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Glue supports **incremental load** which minimizes downtime and data loss</li></ul>SCT DOES NOT CREATE a new schema in target database, only generates a target-compatible schema artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| AWS VPN CloudHub                                            | Uses AWS `Virtual Private Gateway` to create a **hub and spoke** VPN between several on-prem sites and an AWS VPC. Allows for secured VPN communication not just between AWS and on prem but also **between on prem sites** with `Virtual Private Gateway` acting as a VPN Concentrator. The on prem sites IP ranges should not overlap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| EC2 Cluster Placement Group                                 | Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. <br/>Instances in the same cluster placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network.<br/>If you receive a **capacity error** when launching an instance in a placement group that already has running instances, **stop and start all of the instances in the placement group**, and try the launch again. **Starting the instances may migrate them to underlying hardware that has capacity for all of the requested instances**.<br/>To **move an existing instance into** the `Cluster Placement Group` you have to **stop the instance**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| NAT Gateway                                                 | A Single NAT Gateway is limited to 100Gbps of throughput. If need more, split resources between multiple subnets of the same VPC and create a NAT Gateway in each subnet<br/>A `NAT Gateway` is **always** deployed in a **public subnet** and connected to an `IGW`. It cannot be deployed in a private subnet.<br/>When there is a connection time out, a NAT gateway returns an RST packet to any resources behind the NAT gateway which allows for restarting the connection. This is an improvement over the NAT Instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Stateless Applications                                      | A session is unique data for users that persists between requests while they use the application. A stateless application is an application that does not need knowledge of previous interactions and does not store session information. For example, an application that, given the same input, provides the same response to any end user, is a stateless application. Stateless applications can scale horizontally because any of the available compute resources (such as EC2 instances and AWS Lambda functions) can service any request. Without stored session data, you can simply add more compute resources as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
