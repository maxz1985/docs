| Amazon AppStream 2.0                                  | AppStream 2.0 is an AWS End User Computing (EUC) service that can be configured for **SaaS application streaming** or delivery of **virtual desktops with selective persistence**. When AppStream 2.0 is used for virtual desktops, saved files and application settings remain persistent between user sessions, and a fresh virtual desktop is assigned to the user every time they log on.  <br/>Price is based on a monthly fee per streaming user and stream resource required for provisioning.  <br/>Applications can be accessed via browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Amazon Athena                                         | Not a search and analytics engine. Cannot load data from CloudWatch and Kinesis.  <br/>Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive analytics service built on open-source frameworks, supporting open-table and file formats.  <br/>Athena is built on open-source Trino and Presto engines and Apache Spark frameworks, with no provisioning or configuration effort required.  <br/>Ingests data for analysis from different sources including S3. Can use SQL/ML to analyze/query.  <br/>Supports analysis of SQL data sources, not suitable for analyzing open-source data.  <br/>Can be used with AWs Migration Hub to explore collected data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Amazon Aurora                                         | AWS implementation of serverless MySQL or PostgreSQL DB  <br/>This is NOT MySQL or PostgreSQL - this is AWS OWN database implementation `compatible` with MySQL and PostgreSQL  <br/>When RDS MySQL cannot handle the load, Aurora may be a better choice.  <br/><br/>There are 2 TYPES of Aurora - "Aurora Serverless" and "Aurora" (regular)  <br/>The choice is made when selecting the`DB instance class`: "Serverless" OR "Memory optimized" and "Burstable"  <br/>**PAY ATTENTION** to `DB instance class` mentioned.  <br/><br/>"Aurora serverless" is actually serverless.  <br/>Serverless is an on-demand autoscaling configuration. Use for **unpredictable** workloads and pay on "per-second" basis  <br/><br/>"Aurora" (regular) runs on EC2 instances and is for **predictable** workloads.  <br/>"Aurora Memory Optimized" is **NOT serverless**. Memory optimized or burstable Aurora actually has an instance type.  <br/><br/>Configure Aurora inside RDS console. Considered part of RDS.  <br/>Use `FreeLocalStorage` metric in CloudWatch to monitor local storage available for Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL |
| Amazon Aurora Global Database                         | 2 or more Aurora databases deployed in different regions in a cluster. Data is replicated between the regions. Active-standby configuration. <br/> Fail-over when active is failed to a healthy standby: <br/> Detach the *healthy* region to stop replication (this also promotes this region to a standalone DB) <br/> Reconfigure client applications to send writes to the new endpoint. <br/> Add another healthy region to the DB as new secondary to maintain redundancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| AWS IAM Identity Center                               | Use to manage SSO access to AWS using your own AD as authorizer.  <br/>User tries to log into AWS and and the authorization requests is sent to your AD to validate.  <br/>To create SSO with self-managed AD: <ul> <li>Configure AD connector in AWS Directory Service as a Directory Gateway to forward directory requests to Self-managed AD</li> <li>Connect IAM Identity Center to self-managed AD using the AD Connector</li> </ul> <br/>NOTE: Another way to solve it is to create an AWS-managed AD in AWS and establish 2-way trust between your AD and AWS-managed AD. HOWEVER this approach will cache your AD information in AWS. IF there is security requirement NOT to cache info in AWS, use the Directory Gateway approach.  <br/>IF there is a need to use AWS-managed AD as identity source that can be done in `AWS Identity Center > Settings > Identity source > Change identity source` .

AWS Backup will then use the policy.  <br/>Can use Organization Aggregator to collect AWS Config configurations from all accounts in the organization.  <br/>Enable "All Features" in Organizations to apply SCPs to children or to create Firewall Manager rules for all accounts  <br/>To generate Account report from Organizations: <ul> <li>log in as an IAM user (not root, too much privileges for a simple task)</li> <li> `Actions -> Export account list (CSV)` will contain: account ID, email, status</li><li>or use `ListAccounts` API from code, export to S3, schedule Lambda using CloudWatch Events</li> </ul> <br/>Use `DescribeOrganization` API to get info for the ORG the user belongs to.                                                                                                        |
