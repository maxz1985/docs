## On Track
* Set Expectations Early:
* Regular Status Updates
* Ownership via Collaboration Tools
* Intermediate deadlines
* Kanban Dashboard
* Risk Identification
* Buffer time
* Small wins

## Late feature
* understand delay (complexity, resource, external dependency)
* Can it be delayed? (must, should, could, won't haves)
* simplify or down to MVP
* if critical negotiate deadlines
* inform stakeholders on the decision, what is being done to mitigate
* potentially reallocate from less important features to this one

## Risks
* planning
  * define scope
  * define schedule
  * kickoff
* Testing
  * early testing
  * automated testing
  * load testing
  * staging environment
* Communication
  * slack
  * jira
* Dependencies
  * identify at kickoff
  * alternative to
* Last-minute changes
  * code freeze for non-critical
  * change control to assess and approve
* Deployment
  * CD automation
  * canary or rolling or blue-green
  * rollback procedure
* Security
  * secrets encrypted
  * SAST and DAST sonarqube or veracode
* Post-Release

## KPI
* planned vs. actual release date
* scope change/creep in items
* lead change time – days from commit to deployment
* escapes
* regression rate % of defects introduced by new functionality
* test coverage
* `Mean time to recovery` after issue with deployment
* support tickets after release
* velocity
* burndown
