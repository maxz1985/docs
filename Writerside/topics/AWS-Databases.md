| Database type | Related database engines or services             | When would you use it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | What is it optimized for?                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relational    | Amazon Aurora<br/>Amazon RDS<br/>Amazon Redshift | Use when you're migrating or modernizing an on-premises relational workload, or if your workload has less predictable query patterns.                                                                                                                               | Optimized for structured data that is stored in tables, rows, and columns. Relational databases support complex queries through joins.                                                                                  |
| Key-value     | Amazon DynamoDB                                  | Use for workloads such as session stores or shopping carts. Key-value databases can scale to large amounts of data and extremely high throughput of requests, while servicing millions of simultaneous users through distributed processing and storage.            | Optimized for consistent single-digit millisecond performance at any scale (meaning any number of writes and reads).                                                                                                    |
| In-memory     | Amazon ElastiCache<br/>Amazon MemoryDB           | Use Amazon ElastiCache when you need a caching layer to improve read performance. Use Amazon MemoryDB when you need full data persistence, but still need sub-millisecond read latencies.                                                                           | Optimized to support microsecond reads and sub-millisecond writes. MemoryDB supports microsecond reads and single-digit millisecond writes. ElastiCache is an ephemeral cache, while MemoryDB is an in-memory database. |
| Document      | Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)   | Use when you want to store JSON-like documents with rich querying abilities across the fields of the documents.                                                                                                                                                     | Optimized for storing semi-structured data as documents with multilayered attributes.                                                                                                                                   |
| Wide-column   | Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)          | Use when you need to migrate your on-premises Cassandra workloads, or when you need to process data at high speeds for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency.                                                                                  | Optimized for workloads that require heavy reads/writes and high throughput, coupled with low latency and linear scalability.                                                                                           |
| Graph         | Amazon Neptune                                   | Use when you have to model complex networks of objects, such as social networks, fraud detection, and recommendation engine use cases.                                                                                                                              | Optimized for traversing and evaluating large numbers of relationships, and identifying patterns with minimal latency                                                                                                   |
| Time series   | Amazon Timestream                                | Use when you have a large amount of time series data, potentially from a number of sources, such as Internet of Things (IoT) data, application metrics, and asset tracking.                                                                                         | Optimized for storing and querying data that is associated with timestamps and trend lines.                                                                                                                             |
| Ledger        | Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)     | Use when your organization has to communicate with other entities (businesses, customers) and you need a way to verify and trust each other—or when you need to retrieve the current state of data, and also need to prove how data mutated into the current state. | Optimized for maintaining a complete, immutable, and verifiable history of database changes.                                                                                                                            |

## OLTP (OnLine Translation Processing) vs. OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) 
**`Redshift` is the only OLAP choice on AWS**. Everything else is OLTP.

## ACID versus BASE
* ACID—(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) **Transactions** are atomic and **hidden from reads until fully committed**, ensuring strong consistency and **synchronous replication**.
* BASE—(Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) Transactions **may be visible in partial states**, with **asynchronous replication**, prioritizing availability and scalability over immediate consistency.

| **Aspect**         | **ACID**                                           | **BASE**                                                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency**    | Strong (immediate consistency).                    | Eventual (consistency achieved over time).                     |
| **Availability**   | Lower availability during partitioning.            | High availability, even during failures.                       |
| **Scalability**    | Harder to scale horizontally.                      | Built for distributed, horizontally scalable systems.          |
| **Data Integrity** | Guarantees data correctness.                       | Allows temporary inconsistencies.                              |
| **Performance**    | May have higher latency due to strict consistency. | Optimized for speed and scalability.                           |
| **Best For**       | Critical systems requiring strong consistency.     | Large-scale systems prioritizing availability and performance. |
